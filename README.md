# Kill Team Resources
A list of resources for Kill Team (2021 edition, under the Warhammer 40k franchise).

Suggestions/additions are welcome.  You can comment on the [announcement reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/sbw0vw/kill_team_resources_list/), make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jmegner/KillTeamResources/issues), or make a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/jmegner/KillTeamResources/pulls).

Right now, I'm especially interested in this list becoming useful for someone who wants to play via Tabletop Simulator (TTS) and needs to know what are the best mods for maps, models, and little helpers that make gameplay more convenient.

## Rules And Factions, For Human Consumption

* [Wahapedia](https://wahapedia.ru/kill-team2/the-rules/introduction/).
* [ktdash](https://ktdash.app/killteam.htm) web app.


## Rules And Factions, For Programmatic Consumption

* [killteamjson](https://github.com/vjosset/killteamjson) has faction info in json form.  The readme and file names suggest compendium factions only, but I can see commits for non-compendium factions.
* [BattleScribeData Kill Team](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-killteam) repo.  Official data source for BattleScribe.  XML format.


## Calculators and Simulators

Things that calculate or simulate various aspects of gameplay, like various statistics of a shooting or fighting attack.

* [ktcalc/KT21Calculator](https://jmegner.github.io/KT21Calculator/) web app ([source](https://github.com/jmegner/KT21Calculator)).  Uses exact math to calculate outcome probabilities of shooting and fighting attacks.
* [ktsim/KillTeamSimulator2](http://kt2.doit-cms.ru/) web app ([simulation source](https://github.com/ramainen/godicepool).  Monte Carlo simulator for shooting and fighting attacks.
* [ktcomp/KillTeamComparativeSimulator](https://denampavel.shinyapps.io/KTSim/) web app ([source](https://github.com/DenamPavel/KillTeamSim)).  Monte Carlo simulator for comparing shooting attacks of two different attackers against a common defender.
